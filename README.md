# Project Overview

This is a little Unity game project we did for the Ubisoft Reflections and Leamington Winter Jam in January 2023.

It's a bit rough with being a game jam. My immediate next steps are to tidy up some of the code (e.g. reduce singleton usage) and start working on completing the integration of Brian's level generation into the world. Currently the playable part of the game is in the `DetectionTestGym` scene, so load into that if you want to test it in Unity editor.

Beyond that, I'd like to add more environmental hazards and enemy types with more interesting behaviours, and start playing around with more advanced stealth and survival gameplay mechanics.

For now I want to take this on myself, but the work breakdown for the jam was roughly as follows:

- Game Logic, UI, Camera/Controls, Enemy AI: Joe Forster
- Level Generation: Brian Evans
- Custom Assets, HDRP Render Setup: Chris Turvey

# Game Guide

The objective is to collect these crates, but watch out for the creatures that are trying to lure you to your doom! Some may be attracted to light, so be careful with your torch.

It can be tough to keep oriented, so check the arrow to the top right of your submarine to see which was is up.

Playstation controls:
- X fires a decoy
- O drops it behind you
- Square will toggle your torch
- Option (Start) will escape, if you're at the surface depth 0

Xbox controls:
- A fires a decoy
- B drops it behind you
- X will toggle your torch
- Option (Start) will escape, if you're at the surface depth 0

Good luck!
